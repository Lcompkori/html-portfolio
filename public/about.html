<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<p>Hello world! 
</p>

<p>I'm Leanne. A hairdresser, with big goals of breaking into tech! 
  
<p>I have always loved computers and dabbled into coding. Always willing to help my elders when they need computer help (I'm sure anyone can relate to that). </p>

<p>My ultimate goal is to become a data analyst. Currently, I am teaching myself how to code in SQL, and more advanced skills in Excel and Tabelau, and now web development.</p>

<p>Super excited to gain more and more knowledge, skills and experience as I progress through this journey!
