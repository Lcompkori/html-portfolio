<h3>The Black Demon</h3>
    <p>
        Review: <br />
        2 out of 5. <br />
        The idea of the plot was fun (a giant shark attacking characters in the 
        movie). However, most of the action was in the last 30 minutes of the 
        movie, and it was very anti-climactic.

<h3>The Little Mermaid</h3>    
    <p>
        Review: <br />
        3 out of 5 <br />
        The movie live action movie was pretty good overall. 
        For the most part it compared to the cartoon version, 
        following the plot closely. 
        I enjoyed the real-life representation of the characters 
        (Flounder as a fish, Sebastian as a crab, etc.) 
        My two main criticisms is changing Sebastian's story line to not include 
        his role as the musical director, and that Arial forgets that she is 
        supposed to kiss Prince Eric by the end of the third day. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Sebastian as a maestro made the song <i>Under the Sea</i> make more 
        sense, as he was able to produce a song with the various sea creatures 
        on the fly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Arial forgetting that she was supposed to kiss Prince Eric as part of the 
        deal with losing her voice, ended up making her seem a little too ditzy 
        and less interested in the Prince as her love interest.

<h3>Law Abiding Citizen</h3>
    <p>
        Review: <br />
        5 out of 5!<br />
        The plot was complex with a lot of twists. The characters and their 
        development was great. I found myself constantly changing who I was 
        routing for throughout the movie.
